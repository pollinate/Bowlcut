###A library for hairy SVG text manipulation
Written by Duncan Alexander, 2015

###Uses
* Text on a path with various glyph alignments
* Radial text
* Text curved in perspective, like on a garment
* Path direction-agnostic text placement
* Precise kerning and tracking control

###Remaining features to implement
* Tracking min- and max- behaviors
* Stretching and smushing glyphs
* Kerning adjust

###Known bugs
* Text on a circular path with the "tangent" behavior is misaligned in regions

###Special thanks
* Dave Coulter, for helping with the tangent function
